# Responsive_layout
The goal of this project was to create responsive website with media queries.


What I have learnt :
  - use of clearfix, 
  - use of normalize CSS, 
  - how to add commments so that the code is readable, 
  - how to use sudo classes, for example:-->  nav a:hover
  - how to use media queries to adjust the conent to the screen with a specific measuements.
